# Dotfiles

I am still in the infancy ofthe dotfiles journey. I have terrible configs that need work, but I figured getting them up onto git and getting the project going was better than waiting until I could do this perfectly. If you've stumbled upon this, please don't give me too much guff. This is a work in progress and I am just getting started with symlinked dotfiles and extensive configurations. 

## Installation

I currently have this set up to bootstrap but only if you clone the repo into ~/dotfiles. After cloning run

```sh
mkdir ~/.config/alacritty
mkdir ~/.config/nvim
cd ~/dotfiles
bash bootstrap.sh
```
